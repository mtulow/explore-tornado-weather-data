#### Potential Questions:
- What is the distribution of tornadoes by day, week, & month?
- What is the distribution of tornadoes by time of day?
- What is the distribution of tornadoes by city, county, & state?
- What is the distribution of tornadoes by F-scale?
- What is the distribution of tornadoes by length & width of path?
